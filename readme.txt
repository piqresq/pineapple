**Hello!**
Welcome to my site!
**How-to run it**
I used xampp for the server. To run the project with xampp, it must be downloaded and installed and the project folder should be 
placed in C://xampp/htdocs/. After that you may run the server,  the project will be viewable at localhost/pineapple. 
**Database**
I've also included the database in the folder, which can be imported to the server via phpmyadmin. To do that, you may go to
 localhost/phpmyadmin, create a new database and import the database from the projects folder. After that the site will be fully 
functional. 
**Task 3**
For task 3 I created a separate file called db_data.php. To access it you may add that name to localhost/pineapple/.
**Notes**
I've made a font for icons, however the site icon wasn't possible to add to a font because of the complex fill rule 'evenodd'.
